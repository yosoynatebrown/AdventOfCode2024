# Advent Of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository! This repository contains my attempts at solving the daily coding challenges from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event, which takes place every December.

<sub>Note: I realized I wanted to push these to GitHub on part 2 of Day 3 (3.5?) so you won't see Days 1-2 solutions there. I promise to be more of a completist next year. </sub>
